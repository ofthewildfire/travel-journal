# Project Title: Scrimba Basics Solo Project

## Overview

This project is a responsive static page created with React, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript. It serves as a solution to the solo project assignment in Module 2 of the Scrimba React Basics course. Although I was provided with a Figma design, I made several modifications to suit my learning and design preferences.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on mobile and desktop devices.
- **React**: Reusable components.
- **TailwindCSS**: Styling and creating a responsive layout.
- **TypeScript**: Static typing and decalaring interface for data.
- **Props and Spread Syntax**: I used React's spread syntax with props to efficiently pass data to components.
- **Map Function**: Used for generating dynamic lists in React.

## New Concepts Explored

- **TailwindCSS**: Learned to set up and use TailwindCSS CSS styling.
- **TypeScript**: Creation and use of interfaces.
- **ShadCN Components**: Although not utilized in this project, I explored how to set them up for future use.

## Want To Add

While this project is complete, there are additional features and tools I plan to integrate in the future:

- **ShadCN Components**: Incorporate these components to further enhance the UI.
- **Additional Features**: Continuously improve the page with new functionalities and design elements.

## Conclusion

This project was a fantastic learning experience, allowing me to deepen my understanding of React, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript. I enjoyed the process and am excited to apply these skills in future projects.
